Consider the files in the context:


 1 config/base.keymap:

 • Main keymap file for a ZMK keyboard configuration
 • Defines multiple layers (base, nav, fn, num, sys, mouse, sym)
 • Contains complex behaviors like hold-tap, combos, and leader key sequences
 • Includes various custom macros and key definitions

 2 config/combos.dtsi:

 • Defines keyboard combos (pressing multiple keys together)
 • Contains combo timing configurations
 • Maps various key combinations to specific actions
 • Includes visual key position documentation

 3 config/corne.keymap:

 • Specific configuration for the Corne keyboard
 • Includes the base keymap and key labels
 • Acts as the entry point for the keyboard's configuration

 4 config/mouse.dtsi:

 • Mouse movement and scrolling configurations
 • Defines pointer settings for high-resolution displays
 • Contains movement acceleration parameters
 • Sets up mouse movement and scrolling macros

 5 config/leader.dtsi:

 • Configures leader key sequences (similar to Vim's leader key)
 • Defines various Unicode character inputs (German umlauts, Greek letters)
 • Contains Bluetooth and system control sequences
 • Uses custom macro definitions for leader sequences

 6 keymap_drawer_yaml_example.yaml:

 • Visualization configuration for the keymap-drawer tool
 • Defines the keyboard layout and layers for corne. 
 • Maps keys, combos, and their behaviors
 • You ll use this as example.

The files work together to create a complete keyboard firmware configuration with:

 • Multiple layers for different key functions
 • Complex key combinations
 • Mouse control
 • Special character input
 • System control functions
 • Bluetooth connectivity options


consider this config/base.keymap and config/corne.keymap of urob/zmk-config are zmk configuration with my key, shortcuts, and my layout. The config/combos.dtsi. Id like to create a yaml to parse in keymap-drawer (https://github.com/caksoylar/keymap
-drawer) to draw a layout from this keymap. Generate a yaml in the file config/layout.yaml to i generate a layout image for my corne with 42 keys. dont append the file, always rewrite from zero. You can use the keymap_drawer_yaml_example as a example to generate yours as a base. Rules:

- Ignore the keys X_MT, X_MM, X_MB, X_MH 
- All layers must have 42 keys
- if you see a "___" consider this like a undefined key, therefore you can put "{t: "▽", type: trans}".
- For the "layout:" use always this format:
    layout: {qmk_keyboard: corne_rotated, layout_name: LAYOUT_split_3x6_3}
- double check 42 rows/keys/lines in each layer. if its missing some key, add a "{t: "▽", type: trans}".
- When reading a combo in combos.dtsi you can consider its a zmk combo. Also,
  consider the following map to understand the keys to be pressed in the combo:

  /*                KEY POSITIONS

  ╭─────────────────────╮ ╭─────────────────────╮
  │ LT4 LT3 LT2 LT1 LT0 │ │ RT0 RT1 RT2 RT3 RT4 │
  │ LM4 LM3 LM2 LM1 LM0 │ │ RM0 RM1 RM2 RM3 RM4 │
  │ LB4 LB3 LB2 LB1 LB0 │ │ RB0 RB1 RB2 RB3 RB4 │
  ╰───────╮ LH2 LH1 LH0 │ │ RH0 RH1 RH2 ╭───────╯
          ╰─────────────╯ ╰─────────────╯ */ L means left, R right, T top, B bottom, M middle and each number the column index 
          */



  , for
  example: 

  ZMK_COMBO(esc,   &kp ESC,      LT3 LT2,     DEF NAV NUM, COMBO_TERM_FAST, COMBO_IDLE_FAST)

  you should translate to 

  - p: [3, 2]
    k: ESC
    l: [base, nav, num]
